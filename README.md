# spring-boot-backend-portfolio

This codebase is curated and maintained by Uros, a backend engineer specializing in enterprise Java/Spring Boot solutions. It demonstrates best practices in modern backend architecture, API design, and production-quality engineering.

This repository demonstrates an extensible, production-grade backend platform tailored for newsrooms, broadcast, and automation use cases. It showcases how to architect, document, and secure a modern Java backend following best enterprise practices.

## Database Schema Auto-Update

For demo and portfolio purposes, this project is configured with:

    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

This setting demonstrates how automatic database schema updates could be configured in a runnable application, allowing reviewers to understand the approach without manual migration steps.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Usage Warning**  
>
> - In any real production environment, database schema management **must** be handled via migration tools such as [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) or [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/).
> - The `ddl-auto` property should be set to `validate` (or `none`) to prevent accidental schema changes.
> - All credentials and secrets **must** be provided via secure mechanisms and **never committed to version control**.
>
> This configuration is **intentional**, to simplify code review and illustrate project architecture for demo purposes only.  
> **This public repository does not contain a complete, runnable application, and this configuration is provided for demonstration only.**  
> **Do not use this configuration in production.**
>
> _In the full production implementation, all database migrations are version-controlled, all secrets are managed securely, and schema changes are never performed automatically._

## Example API Usage

### User Authentication (Login)
```http
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin123"
}

```

```json
{
  "accessToken": "...",
  "refreshToken": "...",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "username": "admin",
  "fullName": "Admin",
  "role": "ADMIN",
  "user_id": 6
}
```

### Create New User

```http
POST /api/users
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "SuperSecret123",
  "roleId": 2,
  "clientId": 1
}

```

## Highlighted Modules & Utilities

This codebase is not just a CRUD backend, but demonstrates advanced, reusable modules relevant for modern newsroom and broadcast operations.
Key examples include:

WordGeneratorUtil ‚Äî robust DOCX export for stories, scripts, and editorial content (Apache POI based). Supports granular export of news items, comments, and metadata for newsroom workflows.

PdfGeneratorUtil ‚Äî automated PDF generation for rundowns and editorial plans (PDFBox integration), optimized for structured, multi-level content.

GlobalExceptionHandler ‚Äî uniform, production-grade exception mapping across all REST endpoints.

JwtAuthenticationFilter ‚Äî custom JWT security filter for stateless, scalable authentication.

WebSocket Messaging System ‚Äî real-time presence, chat, and newsroom event broadcasting using STOMP/WebSocket with user tracking.

## Testing

Representative unit and integration tests (JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test) are provided in `src/test/java/`.  
These cover the main services and business logic relevant for newsroom automation and backend best practices.

## Observability & Monitoring

This project follows enterprise best practices in observability and operational monitoring:

- **Micrometer metrics** are integrated, exposing key JVM and application metrics via Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
- **Grafana dashboards** are used to visualize JVM memory, GC activity, CPU usage, thread states, log events, HTTP metrics, and other application insights in real time.

A sample Grafana dashboard (JVM/Micrometer):

> **Note:**  
> Some panels display "No data" as this screenshot is from a development environment with limited workloads and integrations enabled.  
> Full observability, alerting, and production monitoring scripts (including advanced metrics and alerting) are available in the private repository and upon request for qualified clients.
